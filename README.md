Making the White Hat Security Club Lab great again

TODO:
* Make sure that Let's Encrypt on the server doesn't break our bot's cert pinning
* Enable TLS (closes #3)
* Server response handling (closes #4)

Requirements (outside of python3-pip)
-------------------------------------

* libssl-dev (to build cryptography with pip3 install cryptography)
